# CodeIgniter 4 Simple Site

## What?

This project aims to create the skeleton of a simple website, which has up to 5 pages.
It comes with a "home" page, an "About Us" page and a functional "contact" page.

## Installation & updates

The initial idea of this project is to be *plug and play*, placing the files
on a CodeIgniter installation and that's it.
